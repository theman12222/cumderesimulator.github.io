The local police were unable to identify any suspects until an investigative journalist convinced them that one of the school's female students was the culprit. An arrest was made, and the schoolgirl went to court to face trial for her alleged crimes.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the time of the trial, Akademi Academy was a household name due to its international prestige. The nature of the trial - a schoolgirl accused of murdering multiple classmates to keep them out of a boy's love life - drew widespread media attention. As a result, the case was the most publicized criminal trial in Japanese history.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of the trial, the schoolgirl was found innocent. The police force who performed the arrest were widely criticized for taking the journalist's claims seriously. The journalist and the local police force were the laughingstock of the country for weeks.<\/p>\n\n<p>This event caused long-lasting changes in the policies of the Buraza Police Bureau. In order to avoid becoming the subject of national scrutiny ever again, they are now extremely reluctant to perform arrests without hard evidence, and dismiss individual eyewitness testimony unless it is backed up by at least 4 other individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p>When performing an investigation, the Buraza Police Bureau is heavily reliant on recent technology invented by Saikou Corp. This new technology allows the police to perform a full forensic investigation of a crime scene within minutes, as opposed to hours or days. For example, this technology can identify all traces of DNA on a murder weapon, allowing the police to identify a murderer almost instantaneously. Within a time span of 6 hours, the police can perform absolutely every type of forensic test possible, with plenty of time left over to question all witnesses present; as a result, if the police can't solve the crime within 6 hours, it's deemed to be unsolvable, and the case is closed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rumors of bribes between Akademi Academy's headmaster and the superintendent of the Buraza Police Bureau are firmly denied.<\/p>","illustrator":"Guillermo Varela Iglesias","illustratorUrl":"http:\/\/kjech.deviantart.com\/","groups":["Others"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/police-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/police.png","name":""}]},{"name":"Info-chan","role":"Information Broker","status":"Ally","personality":"Unscrupulous","appearance":"Week 0","weakness":"?????","description":"<p>\"Info-chan\" is the nickname given to an information broker who specializes in collecting and selling dark secrets.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nobody knows her real name.

Saisho wished for his offspring to inherit his business empire, and intended to train his children to develop the skills and traits necessary to properly manage the multinational corporation he had built.<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>Saisho's daughter was a cheerful and friendly girl who enjoyed creating art and spending time with animals. Saisho felt that his daughter had developed \"undesirable\" personality traits and the \"wrong\" interests for someone who was destined to inherit his corporation. Throughout his daughter's life, he constantly attempted to reshape her personality and redirect her interests, but was never successful.<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>After graduating from Akademi Academy, Saisho's daughter vanished from the public eye entirely. Theories varied wildly; some suspected that she was kidnapped for ransom, and was killed when the ransom was not paid. Others theorized that she was murdered by her father for failing to meet his expectations. However, anyone who interacted with Saisho and his daughter on a daily basis had a much different theory: they suspected that she chose to flee to a foreign country to live a life of her own choosing, instead of living under the oppressive, tyrannical control of her father.<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>When his daughter was only 9 years old, Saisho had already begun to consider the possibility that daughter would fall short of his standards. This was the reason why he decided to have a second child; he recognized the \"mistakes\" he made with his first child, and he was convinced that if he \"tried again\", he could \"get it right this time.\" His second child, Ichirou Saikou, was born for the sole purpose of being a \"backup\" in case his daughter failed him.<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>Saisho carefully designed a very specific upbringing for Ichirou in order to encourage the development of specific personality traits and interests, and discourage the development of any attribute that he considered to be \"unnecessary\". Saisho's methods proved to be incredibly effective; he successfully molded his son into the ideal heir, and crafted the boy into what he considered to be the \"ideal person\".<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>Although Saisho took enormous pride in his son, Ichirou would often make others feel extremely uncomfortable. The boy spoke formally at all times, never expressed emotion, and rarely changed his facial expresison. He was described as \"robotic\" at best, and \"soulless\" at worst. The Saikou family's attendants often wondered if the boy was still capable of independent thought, or if he was simply an empty shell that had been trained to carry out his father's will.<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>In his mid-twenties, Ichirou entered into an arranged marriage. He had two children, in accordance with his father's wishes; \"One as a backup in case the first child fails you.\" Saisho micro-managed the upbringing of his grandchildren, providing his son and daughter-in-law with specific instructions for how to raise their children in order to encourage the development of specific traits, and discourage the development of other traits. Saisho recognized that his original methods produced an heir that was too dispassionate, and adjusted his instructions accordingly so that his grandchildren would turn out to be more personable than his son.<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>Ichirou's daughter, Megami, was a perfect success of the Saisho child-rearing technique; an heir who possessed all desired attributes, as well as a charismatic personality that allowed her to instantly earn the respect and admiration of nearly anyone she spoke to. Ichirou's son, Kencho, was raised with the exact same methods, but developed numerous negative personality traits. It is possible that these traits developed as a result of the boy developing an inferiority complex with his sister.<\/div>\n\n<div><\/div>\n\n<div>Shortly before the events of Yandere Simulator, Saisho Saikou retired and handed control of his company to his son, Ichirou. The headmaster of Akademi reports directly to Ichirou, respectfully referring to him as \"Mr. Saikou\".

She was first in line to inherit Saikou Corp from her father, although it would ultimately be her brother who inherited the company.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the daughter of one of the most intelligent and influential men of the 20th century, many people expected her to excel academically. However, throughout her teenage years, her performance at school was never above average. Because she failed to live up to the impossibly high expectations placed on her, she was treated unkindly by her peers, leading her to have many unpleasant experiences throughout high school.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to press releases from Saikou Corp, Saisho Saikou was heartbroken to see his daughter unhappy, so he came up with a way to let her \"re-live\" high school while still continuing her education: he paid for the construction of an academy that is meant to resemble a traditional Japanese high school as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Official sources claim that Saisho Saikou wanted to give his daughter the perfect \"high school experience\", so he tailored the school to her exact tastes. Ichiko loves the countryside, so Akademi was built in a rural area. Ichiko's favorite colors are white and gold, which is why Akademi has a white and gold color scheme. Ichiko loves symmetry, so the school building has a square shape. Ichiko adores \"sailor-style\" school uniforms, so Akademi's uniforms were designed to resemble middle-school uniforms instead of the blazers that are more commonly found in traditional Japanese high schools.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the late 1980s, there were rumors that the officially-given explanation for Akademi's construction was a carefully crafted lie, and that the true reason for the school's existence was much more sinister. These rumors claimed that Saisho was tremendously disappointed in his daughter for failing to live up to his own legacy, and had created Akademi to be a school-themed \"boot camp\" designed to whip her into shape and train her to become the perfect heir to his company. Interest in these rumors slowly declined over time due to a lack of evidence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ichiko graduated from Akademi in 1989. With Ichiko gone, the school had finished serving its original purpose - but it was not closed down. Saikou Corp decided to market Akademi as an elite school for high school graduates who wanted to continue their education in an setting that simulates the feeling of a high school environment. Aspiring students must be at least 18 years old in order to apply for enrollment at Akademi. If accepted, students can choose to be a \"first-year\", \"second-year\", or \"third-year\" student. Some students enroll in Akademi purely to recieve an elite education, while a very small minority enroll because they want to re-live their high school years once last time before they move on to college.<\/p>\n\n<p>The school's name has its origins in Ichiko's childhood. When Ichiko Saikou was a young girl, she adored a bedtime story about a school for young witches and wizards called \"the Akademi Institute.\" When Saisho built the school, he named it \"Akademi Academy\" - but saying the school's name feels like saying the same word twice, so most people just call it \"Akademi.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Ichiko Saikou vanished from the public eye in 1990. The disappearance of Ichiko Saikou is a mystery; nobody knows why she vanished or where she went. Some people theorize that she may have been unable to handle the immense expectations placed on her by her father and the world, so she fled Japan to live in secrecy overseas, where she enjoys a quiet and peaceful life. Other, more extreme theories postulate that her father executed her for failing to live up to his standards. To this day, nobody knows the ultimate fate of Ichiko Saikou or where on Earth she might be.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, elderly people recall that Ichiko had a twin sister, even though there is no evidence that this twin ever existed.

The founder of the Saikou Corporation was one such person.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the 74 years since it was first established, the Saikou Corporation has had an undeniable impact on the everyday lives of millions of people. There is not a single industry that has not been revolutionized by one of Saikou Corp's innovations, nor is there a single household that does not possess at least one Saikou Corp invention. There was no name that dominated the second half of the 1900s more than \"Saikou\", and there is no one alive who would deny that Saikou Corp is the most successful conglomerate in human history.<\/p>\n\n<p>A significant portion of Saikou Corp's success can be attributed to its founder's extremely strict hiring policies; he insisted on employing none other than the brightest minds in the world, even for the most menial positions in his company. In fact, he refused to hire a secretary for nearly a decade, because there was no one who could meet his astronomically high standards: an IQ above 140, multiple doctorates from a prestigious university, and prior experience as the CEO of a successful company. In addition to these criteria, he also insisted that his secretary was exceptionally attractive. \"Excellence\" was never enough for him; only \"Perfection\" would suffice, and so he refused to be represented by someone whose appearance could be described as anything less than ideal beauty. At the end of a decade-long search, he finally found someone who met his criteria and desired the position.<\/p>\n\n<p>The founder of Saikou Corp took great care of his public image, as any damage to his reputation would directly impact the success of his company. He firmly believed that his social standing would be affected by the woman he chose to marry, and so he was determined to accept nothing less than the perfect woman for his wife. He refused to marry for many years, finding no woman to be worthy of him, until he eventually realized that his secretary was the only woman who could meet his criteria.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though his secretary was outwardly perfect, he would not even consider proposing marriage to her until he had confirmed that she was not carrying any invisible flaws that were going to manifest in the future. He went as far as to analyze her DNA and study her family's medical history to confirm that she was not likely to be in possession of any hereditary diseases that she could pass to her future children. He only made the decision to propose to her after confirming that she was as genetically \"perfect\" as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one of the wisest decisions that the founder ever made was to hide the majority of his personal beliefs and political stances from the public; most people would have been shocked or even outraged at some of his most conservative opinions. He was firmly convinced that the human race should proactively improve the quality of its population by excluding certain \"inferior\" genetic groups, and promoting other \"superior\" genetic groups...but he knew that advocating for eugenics would annihilate his public image, so he kept this belief, along with many others, a closely-guarded secret.<\/p>\n\n<p>After going through a great effort to ensure that his offspring were as genetically \"perfect\" as possible, he was determined to prevent his children from ruining the gene pool that he had carefully cultivated. To this end, he insisted on selecting the woman that his son would marry. The process was identical to the one that he used to choose his original secretary, except now he was also carefully screening applicants for hereditary diseases, \"undesirable\" genes, and so on. The number of women who wished to marry into the Saikou family was very high, but the number of valid candidates was extremely low. Eventually, however, he did find a woman who fulfilled his extremely specific criteria.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before he would allow this woman to become a part of the Saikou bloodline, he insisted on hiring her as his secretary, so that he could judge her competence firsthand. After he was firmly convinced that this woman was worthy of bearing his grandchildren, he allowed - or, rather, commanded - his son to marry her.<\/p>\n\n<p>This woman, once an extremely ambitious and driven entrepreneur, was the CEO of the only company that stood a chance of competing against Saikou Corp. However, after it became clear that her business would never be able to outperform the invincible corporation, she made the decision to liquidate her company and find a different way to \"defeat\" Saikou Corp.

They all share a similar fashion style which was invented by their leader, Musume, who combined elements of the \"gal,\" \"gyaru,\" and \"ganguro\" fashion trends. They have been known to ruthlessly bully anyone that they see as \"beneath\" them. This bullying often goes unreported, because nobody would want to get on the Bullies' bad side and become their new target.<\/p>\n\n<p>The leader of the Bullies is named Mutsumi Rokuda. She is the daughter of a well-known loan shark, which has earned her the nickname \"Musume Ronshaku,\" which translates to \"Daughter Loanshark.\" Her rich father spoiled her rotten, and as a result, Musume grew up without any reason to treat others with kindness or respect. Gradually, she developed the belief that most people are \"beneath\" her, and that the \"lowest\" people are mere playthings for her to torment. Like a child who never learned the difference between right and wrong, she simply lacks the ability to see her victims as people who deserve empathy or compassion. She doesn't deliberately seek out victims, but when she spots one, she will happily seize the opportunity to treat another person like dirt.<\/p>\n\n<p>Throughout her life, Musume rarely had to face any sort of consequences for her poor behavior. Her father's reputation intimidated most of her teachers and classmates, so most authority figures refused to discipline her, and most kids refused to stand up to her. If she ever did anything seriously bad, her father would make the problem go away using money...or his special brand of intimidation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kashiko Murasaki is a mischief-maker and an instigator. She enjoys spreading gossip and rumors so that she can watch the outcome from afar, silently proud of herself for successfully manipulating the actions of others. Her gossip often causes permanent damage to the relationships of other people, but she doesn't care. She rationalizes her behavior by insisting that her actions are merely harmless pranks, and that any consequences are the fault of others who are not handling her pranks well enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hana Daidaiyama suffers from a severe inferiority complex that stems from several incidents in her past. She is deeply insecure about herself - everything from her appearance to her intelligence - and she feels a powerful, irresistible urge to find reasons to look down on others, so that she can feel better about herself by comparison. For this reason, she is obsessed with finding skeletons in other peoples' closets, and dragging out those skeletons for the world to see. She doesn't care what consequences her actions have in the lives of others, as long as she can feel superior to them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kokoro Momoiro was a victim of severe merciless bullying at her last school, and has resolved to never be a victim again. Upon arriving at Akademi, she immediately sought out the \"bullies\" of the school and desperately tried to get into their good graces for the purpose of making them see her as an ally, and not as a potential target. The firsthand knowledge of what it feels like to be bullied is still fresh in her mind, and she has absolutely no desire to abuse others, but she does it anyway...because she knows that she has to keep up the facade of being a bully in order to avoid being targeted by Musume and her friends. She has become what she hates, which has caused her to loathe herself deeply, but she would still rather hate herself than return to being harmed by others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hoshiko Mizudori is different from the other members of the bullies. She has no excuse for her behavior, such as receiving a poor upraising, having an inferiority complex, or being a former victim. She is simply a <em>cruel person<\/em>. The one and only thing that she cares about is her own personal gratification. Nothing else matters to her, especially not the thoughts and feelings of other people. She doesn't use any form of rationalization to convince herself that she is justified in harming others; the pure enjoyment she gets from doing so is reason enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>With that said, Hoshiko understands the importance of keeping her urges and actions secret from others, so she has mastered the art of being a social chameleon and pretending to be a normal, well-adjusted person. It is only when she is alone with a victim that her true, sadistic nature is revealed.

During the previous year, there were five students at Akademi who were subjected to severe bullying. The school faculty was informed about the bullying, but none of the victims were able to provide concrete evidence that the bullying had been taking place, so the faculty refused to take action. The bullying eventually became so severe that the victims were considering a suicide pact. However, before this could take place, the victims witnessed something extraordinary that saved them from a self-destructive path.<\/p>\n\n<p>One day, outside of the entrance to the school, the bullied victims witnessed one of their fellow students - Osoro Shidesu - single-handedly fight off a group of violent aggressors from another school. Against all odds, Osoro actually managed to defeat all of her opponents, despite their superior numbers. Instantly, Osoro became an icon to them - a physical embodiment of the idea that a single person can stand against a group of tormentors and prevail. From that day forward, the bullied victims idolized Osoro.<\/p>\n\n<p>Osoro had demonstrated that violence was a viable solution to their problems, and that a fearsome reputation would keep their enemies away. The five bullied students began imitating Osoro; they started acting gruff, unfriendly, and standoffish, exactly like her. They dyed their hair blonde, just like hers. They styled their hair to give themselves the appearances of rebellious punks, and began carrying long, blunt objects at all times. They began showing up late to class, disrespecting faculty members, and so forth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Those five boys were originally targeted by bullies because they were the meekest students at school - and now they had become the exact opposite. Needless to say, the bullying stopped...but at a cost. The rest of the students at school began to fear them and avoid them, referring to them as \"the delinquents.\" This was exactly what they wanted; they'd much rather be feared and hated than be bullied and victimized. However, the faculty and the headmaster began to view them as a growing problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>The headmaster refused to accept the presence of delinquents at a prestigious school like Akademi. In a faculty meeting, he announced that he was going to expel them all, including Osoro, purely for being a negative influence. However, the guidance counselor stopped him. She regretted not stepping in and taking action while they were being bullied, and insisted on being given a chance to reform the delinquents, rather than simply expelling them without trying anything else first.<\/p>\n\n<p>The guidance counselor and the headmaster were able to reach an agreement: the faculty and the student council will tolerate the delinquents' behavior for a period of 10 weeks, and give the counselor a chance to reform them. However, this arrangement comes at a cost: if the counselor is unable to reform the delinquents within 10 weeks, she will be dismissed from the school.<\/p>\n\n<p>The counselor recognized that it would be difficult to reform the delinquents while their biggest influence - Osoro - was still present at school. The next time that Osoro slipped up, the counselor expelled her for a period of 8 weeks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Will the counselor be able to reform the delinquents before the deadline? Only time will tell.<\/p>","illustrator":"Mulberry","illustratorUrl":"https:\/\/www.deviantart.com\/mulberryart","groups":["Groups"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/delinquents-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/delinquents.png","name":"Group"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/eye-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/eye.png","name":"Umeji"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/cheek-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/cheek.png","name":"Hokuto"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/forehead-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/forehead.png","name":"Gaku"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/nose-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/nose.png","name":"Hayanari"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/mouth-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/mouth.png","name":"Dairoku"}]},{"name":"Student Council","role":"Authority","status":"Active","personality":"Strict","appearance":"Week 1","weakness":"?????","description":"<p>Megami Saikou, the Student Council President, strives for excellence in all things.

She was defeated by Megami in the most recent student council election. However, Megami acknowledged that Kuroko was the second-best person for the job, and offered her the role of vice president. Kuroko accepted the offer.<\/p>\n\n<p>While Megami is absent from school, Kuroko is in charge of Megami's presidential duties. In short, Kuroko fills the role of student council president while Megami is gone. Kuroko is known for being formal at all times, which is reflected in the way she stands, walks and speaks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Akane Toriyasu is the Secretary of the student council.

Perhaps this may be part of the reason why Megami decided to include her on the Student Council.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aoi Ryugoku is the Enforcer of the Student Council. That means her job is to maintain peace throughout the school. She is a very physically imposing person, so it's no mystery why Megami chose her for this position. However, she's been known to take her job a little too seriously.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a handful of students at school who hide one of their eyes for some personal reason, but Aoi is currently the only student who is 100% confirmed to actually be missing an eye. As of now, there are only two students at school who know how Aoi lost her eye.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shiromi Torayoshi is the treasurer of the student council. She's a peculiar young woman whose intentions are never clear. She is known for smiling at almost every hour of the day, in every type of situation, which is unsettling to some students.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shiromi is an enigma; very few students know anything about her. Just about the only thing that anyone knows for certain is that she is very eccentric, and takes pleasure in performing harmless pranks on other students.<\/p>\n\n<p>Megami has reason to believe that there is \"a dangerous person\" on school grounds, so she has warned the Student Council to be extremely cautious over the next 10 weeks, and has authorized them to carry pepper spray on school grounds. As a result of Megami's warning, the Student Council are much more alert than other students, and will bust out a can of pepper spray at the slightest sign that their lives may be in danger.<\/p>","illustrator":"Mulberry","illustratorUrl":"https:\/\/www.deviantart.com\/mulberryart","groups":["Groups"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/council-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/council.png","name":"Council"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/goddess-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/goddess.png","name":"President"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/turtle-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/turtle.png","name":"Vice President"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/bird-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/bird.png","name":"Secretary"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/dragon-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/dragon.png","name":"Enforcer"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/tiger-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/tiger.png","name":"Treasurer"}]},{"name":"Midori","role":"Student","status":"Alive","personality":"Inquisitive","appearance":"Week 1","weakness":"Herself","description":"<p>A very curious and inquisitive girl.<\/p>\n\n<p>She has gained a reputation for constantly asking foolish questions, which can often irritate her teachers and fellow classmates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Claims that she is a video game character who can see beyond the fourth wall of the game she's in, but has given up trying to convince people to believe her.<\/p>","illustrator":"Mulberry","illustratorUrl":"https:\/\/www.deviantart.com\/mulberryart","groups":["Other"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/green-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/green.png","name":"Normal"},{"url":"\/img\/characters\/green-text-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/green-text.png","name":"Sexy Cat"}]},{"name":"Mae Kunahito","role":"Guidance Counselor","status":"Faculty","personality":"Strict Disciplinarian","appearance":"1989","weakness":"None","description":"<p>Mae Kunahito is the mother of Genka Kunahito.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mae served as the guidance counselor at Akademi for 30 years.

While attending Akademi in 1988, Sonoko Sakanoue started studying the killer's cipher as a hobby.<\/p>\n\n<p>After many long nights, Sonoko cracked the code and figured out killer's cipher.
